QUESTION:

Input
chars =
["a","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b","b"]
Output
["a","b","1","2"]
Expected
["a","b","1","2"]

Explanation: if freq of a char is 1 freq should not be added like "ch1"--assuming 1 is freq of ch. if freq is double or triple digit all digits of it should be inserted in contiguous manner.

CONSTRAINT: should be IN-PLACE

ie. algo will modify the chars = ["a","2","b","2","c","3"] & solve problem using this.

  
Algorithm:

	Step1: Loop through the char Array(Good to use While)

	Step2: check for repeating characters
		
		a. store every character in to ch

		b. while i < n and ch == ith element

			increment i  and increment count//count was initialized to 0
	step3:  three scenarios with count:
		
		case 1: count == 1 continue to the next iteration
	
		case2: count < 10 add count to particular position using toString().
	
		case3: count is double or triple digit > 10 convert toString then 
	
		       iterate and add to the position.


	step4: len of updated arr.


Note: try to use read Write approach. like char[len++] = blah blah;
